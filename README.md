# M5 Stack Atom Matrix Challenge
**Part II, Kitchen Timer. Group 19 (Guglielmo Fonda, Aya El Mir, Aliha Anshira, Milos VojinoviÄ‡)**

This repositary contains the solution to the challenge proposed in the course from the NYU Abu Dhabi University: ENGR-UH 1021J Design & Innovation Summer 2021 by Instructor Matthew Karau.

The only library used was the M5 Atom Library and the guide for installation can be found [here] (https://docs.m5stack.com/en/arduino/arduino_development).

The solution uses the M5 Atom device to allow the user to set 2 timers and monitor their progress both in the real world and through a webpage.
