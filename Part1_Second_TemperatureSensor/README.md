**Part I, The Second, Temperature sensing device. Group 19 (Guglielmo Fonda, Aya El Mir, Aliha Anshira, Milos VojinoviÄ‡)**

Demontration video of the temperature sensing device available on [Youtube here] (https://youtu.be/GywzBrWc-GI)

This repositary contains the solution to the challenge proposed in the course from the NYU Abu Dhabi University: ENGR-UH 1021J Design & Innovation Summer 2021 by Instructor Matthew Karau.

The only library used was the M5 Atom Library and the guide for installation can be found [here] (https://docs.m5stack.com/en/arduino/arduino_development).

1.The solution uses the M5 Atom device proposes the following modes :

a.Show Active temperature + Units.

b.Show average of last 24 hours of temperature + Units.

c.Show color scale of temperature range + current temperature as color.

d.Show graph of temperature across a predefined range.

e.Change units.


2.User guide for switching between the modes:

a.Activating the screen:
When the device in hand is in a position with the screen facing relatively upwards, tapping the screen or pressing the screen button activates the screen.

b.Changing modes:
When the screen is activated, the user is able to change modes by tipping the device left or right.

c.Activating modes:
The user either clicks the screen or taps the device to activate a given mode.

d. Exiting an active mode:
The user turns the device face-down, and the device returns to background reading mode with screen off.
